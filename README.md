# FLS
A handy `ls` remake, purely for learning.
### Why FLS?
There's no reason, at all, don't use it. I just want to learn Rust :D
### Usage
Flags:
`-i = Use icons`
Running:
`cargo run -- -flags`
For example, `cargo run -- -i` (prints out icons)
### Contribute
Make a PR, I'm sure you are a greater coder than me.
